Start the server by running WhiteboardServer with the desired port.

Start as many clients as you wish by running ClientGUI, putting in your IP and current port.

Now you can click to draw, change whiteboards, colors, usernames, etc.


External Libraries:

We decided to use JSON as it simplified message passing and allowed us to communicate without
worrying about grammar specifically.
